## Panopto Multi-Stream Migration 

The migration of the two-stream Panopto session was completed in three straightforward phases: exporting files, transferring files, and rebuilding the session. As the user, here's what I did:

### Exporting Source Files

My initial step was to retrieve the content from the **Source Panopto Instance**. To secure the highest quality, I downloaded the two streams separately:

* I requested and saved the MP4 file for the **Primary Stream** (main video and audio).
* I then requested and saved the MP4 file for the **Secondary Stream** (slides or screen capture).

Once both original, high-quality video files were on my local machine, I proceeded to the next stage.

### File Transfer and Session Build

Next, I worked within the **Destination Panopto Instance**. The session was rebuilt using the dedicated **'Build a Session'** tool:

* I uploaded both the **Primary and Secondary stream files** to the server.
* The destination server automatically processed the uploads and **synchronised the streams** to recreate the multi-stream presentation.

### Checking and Publishing

The final step was essential quality control and completion:

* I accessed the session editor to **check the stream synchronisation** and verify the audio timing.
* After confirming the correct alignment, I applied the changes and **published the new, complete session** on the destination system.
